# direction-of-arrival
direction-of-arrival is my doctoral project. A collection of DOA algorithms implemented in Matlab, with noise and channel models implemented. It's analyzed the performance of synthetic and real data.

## Getting Started
Main code in performance_evaluations.

### Prerequisites
Matlab (Min: R2007a)

### Directories
- performance_evaluations

DOA algorithms and performance evaluation.

- lab

Experimental codes for development of new algorithms.

- tests

Test environment.

## Running the Tests
Automatic tests.

### Simulation Data Test
